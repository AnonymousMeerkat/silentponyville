title: We need help!
---
In order to minimize time wasted on mostly useless paragraphs (like this one), we'll cut straight to the chase.
<br /><br />
We need:
<br /><br />
<dl>
    <dt>Background artists</dt>
    <dd>
        In order to make this game shine, we have to have slightly more than a black background (and no, green will not do the trick here either :P).
        <br /><br />
        Qualifications needed:
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Ability to create a background from scratch (by scratch, we mean, not a modification of another background)</li>
            <li>Ability to do a pixel art style (not absolutely needed, but it would be great if you could)</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Cutscene artists and/or animators</dt>
    <dd>
        Qualifications needed:
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Ability to create a cutscene depicting a story, either from an amount of static images, or from an animation</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Voice actors</dt>
    <dd>
        At the moment, we are only interested in monster sounds (e.g. groans, wails, screams, etc...), and a few lines from pinkie pie.
        <br /><br />
        Once we have the story finished, we will revisit this.
    </dd>
